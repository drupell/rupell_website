3) In package.json:
    Removed script "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    Added script "dev", "build", and "start" for usage.

4) Back to terminal:
    npm run dev - runs the website on local host.
    npm install --save @zeit/next-css - adds dependencies for styling.

5) Adding components and more:
    - Added static folder for things like pictures, backgrounds, etc. that will be used by next
    - Added next.config file to require us to have '@zeit/next-css' dependency so we can use css in the code.
