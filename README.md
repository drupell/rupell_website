This is a personal project started with the intention to refine recently picked up skills and to learn more.
This file shows initial steps on how I got the project up and running, as well as a changelog that
displays changes that were made before VCS/git compatibility was added.

Author: David Rupell

Getting started with this project:
PALETTON BASE RGB: 383838 (used to grab rgb colors and fit it to a theme - accessed at paletton.com)
Background image is free use stock image, edited in GIMP.
Logos, pulled from school sites and edited to match scheme.

INITIAL STEPS 05/15/2020:-
1) In the terminal:
    npm init - gets the package.json file ready with required information.
    npm install next react react-dom - adds required dependencies.

2) Created "pages" directory and index.js file.

3) In package.json:
    Removed script "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    Added script "dev", "build", and "start" for usage.

4) Back to terminal:
    npm run dev - runs the website on local host.
    npm install --save @zeit/next-css - adds dependencies for styling.

5) Adding components and more:
    - Added static folder for things like pictures, backgrounds, etc. that will be used by next
    - Added next.config file to require us to have '@zeit/next-css' dependency so we can use css in the code.
    - Added data folder to hold data that we need to work with and display. (data.json)

Change log:
05/16/2020:
    Changed card height from 480px.
    Created components folder - houses the header, footer, and layout elements that are used throughout each page.
    
05/17/2020:
    Added resume button in InfoCard (with appropriate css) as well as general functionality on resume page.
    
05/20/2020:
    Added more documentation, .gitignore file, and git repository for version control.
    Fixed small errors/warnings.
    Changes poorly named element to a button and fixes mismatch parameters.
    Moved title-setting statement to Layout.js, added icons and display functionality. (Icons in static,
    display in Layout)
    Adjusted styling for the footer note - moved the text to the center and made it slightly lighter so it didn't 
    stand out so much.
    Removed className tags that referred to css styles that were removed in index.js and InfoCard.js.
    Moved a className tag from index to Layout.
    Slightly cleaned up some of the documentation.
